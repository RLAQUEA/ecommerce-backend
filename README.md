# Ecommerce Backend 

This application is the shell for an ecommerce store, which functions as an api, constructed with packages such as node.js, express, and sequelize.  The application uses a database containing categories, products and their associated tags, and the api can retrieve information about each category, product and tag.  The user can also retrieve this information, update, or delete it using GET, POST, PUT & DELETE methods.
